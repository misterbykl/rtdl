# rtdl - The Real-Time Data Lake ‚ö°Ô∏è
rtdl makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You configure a data stream 
with a source (from a tool like Segment) and a cloud storage destination, and rtdl builds you 
a real-time data lake in Parquet format cataloged in Apache Hive Metastore ‚Äì so you can access 
your real-time data with common BI and ML tools. You provide the streams, rtdl builds your lake.

## V0.0.1 - Current status -- what works and what doesn't

### What works? üöÄ
rtdl is not full-features yet, but it is currently functional. You can configure streams that 
ingest json from an rtdl endpoint, process them into Parquet, and save the files to a destination 
configured in your stream. rtdl can write files locally, to AWS S3, and to GCP Cloud Storage.

### What doesn't work/what's next on the roadmap? üö¥üèº
  * Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a contributor license agreement
  * Cataloging data in Hive Metastore
    * This will let you use your data with a much broader range of data tools.
  * Adding Presto to the stack
    * This will make connecting into a whole ecosystem of analytics, BI, and data science tools 
    much easier
  * Adding support for Azure Blob Storage


## Quickstart üå±
### Initialize the rtdl services
1.  Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d`.
    * **Note:** This configuration should be fault-tolerant, but if any containers or 
      processes fail when running this, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down` 
      and retry.
2.  After containers `rtdl_rtdl-db-init`, `rtdl_catalog-db-init`, and `rtdl_catalog-init` 
    exit and complete with `EXITED (0)`, kill and delete the rtdl container set by running 
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down`
3.  Run `docker compose up -d` every time after.
    * `docker compose down` to stop.

### Interact with rtdl services and create a data lake
All API calls used to interact with rtdl have Postman examples in our [postman-rtdl-public repo](https://github.com/realtimedatalake/postman-rtdl-public).
1.  If you are building your data lake on AWS or GCP, configure your storage buckets and access 
    by following the [RudderStack docs for AWS S3](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/storage-platforms/amazon-s3/) or the [Segment docs for Google Cloud Storage](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/catalog/google-cloud-storage/). 
    * For AWS S3 storage, you will need your bucket name, your AWS access key id, and your AWS
      secret access key.
    * For GCP Cloud Storage, you will need your credentials in flattened json (remove all the 
      newlines).
3.  Instrument your website with [analytics-next-cc] - our fork of [Segment's Analytics.js 2.0](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/) 
    that let's you cc all of the events you send to Segment to rtdl's ingest endpoint. Its 
    snippet is a drop-in replacement of Analytics.js 2.0/Analytics.js. Using this makes it really 
    easy to build your data lake with existing Segment instrumentation. Enter your ingest endpoint
    as the `ccUrl` value and rtdl will handle the payload. Make sure you enter your writeKey in the 
    `stream_alt_id` of your `stream` configuration (below).
    * Alternatively, you can send ***any*** json with just ```stream_id``` in the payload and rtdl will add it to your lake.
      ```
      {
          "stream_id":"837a8d07-cd06-4e17-bcd8-aef0b5e48d31",
          "name":"user1",
          "array":[1,2,3],
          "properties":{"age":20}
      }
      ```
	You can optionally add ```message_type``` should you choose to override the ```message_type``` specified while creating the stream.
	rtdl will default to a message type ```rtdl_default``` if message type is absent in both stream definition and actual message
	
	
4.  Create/read/update/delete `stream` configurations that define a source data stream into 
    your data lake and the destination data store as well as configure folder partitioning and 
    file compression. It also allows for activating/deactivating a stream.
    * For any json data being sent to the ingest endpoint, the generated `stream_id` or the 
      manually input `stream_alt_id` values are required in the payload.

**Note:** To start from scratch, first run `rm -rf storage/` from the rtdl root folder.


## Architecture üèõ
rtdl has a multi-service architecture composed of tested and trusted open source tools 
to process and catalog your data and custom-built services to interact with them more easily.

### config services üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

#### config
API service written in Go. Use the API to create, read, update, acvitivate, deactivate, 
and delete `stream` records. `stream` records store the configuration information for 
the different data streams you want to send to your data lake. This service can also be 
used to lookup master data necessary for creating successful `stream` records like 
`file_store_types`, `partition_times`, and `compression_types`.  
**Environment Variables:** RTDL_DB_HOST, RTDL_DB_USER, RTDL_DB_PASSWORD, RTDL_DB_DBNAME  
**Public Port:** 80  
**Endpoints:**
  * /getStream -- POST; `stream_id` required
  * /getAllStreams -- GET
  * /getAllActiveStreams -- GET
  * /createStream -- POST; `message_type` and `folder_name` required
  * /updateStream -- PUT; all fields required (any missing fields will be replaced with NULL 
    values)
  * /deleteStream -- DELETE; `stream_id` required
  * /activateStream -- PUT; `stream_id` required
  * /deactivateStream -- PUT; `stream_id` required
  * /getAllFileStoreTypes -- GET
  * /getAllPartitionTimes -- GET
  * /getAllCompressionTypes -- GET
  
  Sample ```createStream``` payload for creating Parquet file in AWS S3
  ```	
  {
	"active": true,
    "message_type": "test-msg-aws",
	"file_store_type_id": 2,
	"region": "us-east-1",
	"bucket_name": "testBucketAWS",
	"folder_name": "testFolderAWS",
    "partition_time_id": 1,
    "compression_type_id": 1,
	"aws_access_key_id": "[aws_access_key_id]",
    "aws_secret_access_key": "[aws_secret_access_key]"
  }
  ```
  
  ```file_store_type_id``` - 1 for Local, 2 for AWS, 3 for GCS
  ```partiion_time_id``` - 1 - HOURLY, 2 - DAILY, 3 - WEEKLY, 4 - MONTHLY, 5 - QAURTERLY
  ```compression_type_id``` - 1 - SNAPPY (Default), 2 - GZIP, 3 - LZO 
  
  For cloud storage - final file path would be 
  ```<bucket>/<folder>/<message type>/<time partition>/*.parquet```
  
  ```time partition``` part can look like 
	```2021-06-15-13```(Hourly), 
	```2021-06-15```(Daily),
	```2021-48```(Weekly - ISOWeek), 
	```2021-06```(Monthly),
	```2021-02```(Quarterly)
	
  The leaf-level file would have timestamp upto milliseconds as the file name
